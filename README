***********************************************
* Morphological Analyzer for Latvian Language *
***********************************************

 A Java library for analyzing morphology and part of speech information for Latvian words.
 Accurate analysis is based on an included lexicon of some 50.000 lexemes, for rarer words there is some ambiguity.
 Also includes generation of all inflections of a word, and crude statistical disambiguation for analysis.
 
BASIC USAGE

 Analyzer analyzer = new Analyzer();
 
 // analysis
 Word result = analyzer.analyze("roku");
 for (Wordform wf : result.wordforms) {
	wf.describe();
 }

 // generation of inflections
 List<Wordform> wordforms = analyzer.generateInflections("rakt");
 for (Wordform wf : wordforms) {
	wf.describe();
 }

 Review unit tests for more examples.
